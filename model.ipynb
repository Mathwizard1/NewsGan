      "('Did a Russian Prostitute Say Donald Trump Was Poorly Endowed? A Russian sex worker said Donald Trump was one of her clients and that he has a small penis. On 13 January 2017, the World News Daily Report (WNDR) web site built upon salacious rumors swirling about Donald Trump in an article claiming a Russian sex worker had revealed the President-elect has a small penis: A 22-year sex worker named Ivana Kamensky, claims she was one of the prostitutes who had sexual intercourse with Donald Trump in Moscow in 2011, adding that the American President had the smallest penis she had ever seen. In an interview with the Moscow Daily Herald, the young woman described in great details the night that she allegedly spent in Mr Trump\\'s hotel room five years ago[, claiming] she was hired by Donald Trump along with two of her friends to perform several degrading sex acts, like urinating on him and on each other. She said that she had been shocked by the incredibly small size of his penis, and remembers laughing about it with the other two girls She described Mr.Trump\\'s genitals as being the size of a grape, barely one inch (2.5cm) long when fully erect. There was no truth to this story, which originated with the World News Daily Report fake news site. The photographs of the \"Russian prostitute\" that accompanied the WNDR article were actually a pictures of Svetlana Travis, a woman accused in 2016 of falsely claiming that former New York State Gov. Eliot Spitzer had assaulted her. WNDR typically mines the web for unrelated photographs to attach to their fake news articles.', 'George Soros Said: I\\'m Going to Bring Down the U.S. by Funding Black Hate Groups\\'? George Soros said that he funded the Black Lives Matter movement because he wanted to \\'bring down the United States\\' and \\'the black community is the easiest to manipulate.\\' In August 2016, a graphic featuring a picture of billionaire George Soros next to a quote ostensibly uttered by him about his goal to \"bring down the United States by funding Black Hate groups\" began circulating via social media: Although this image indicated that the business magnate and political activist made this comment during the course of an interview with the Germany newspaper Bild in September 2014, we found no evidence that any such interview took place. The putative statement from Soros about his funding \"Black Hate groups\" does not appear in the newspaper\\'s archives for September 2014 (or any other month), nor did we find reference to it in any other credible publication. The first iteration of this quote we could uncover appeared on the Tumblr page \"Overpasses for America\" in an article published on 19 August 2016, nearly two years after Soros allegedly issued these inflammatory remarks. Aside from the suspicious lack of documentation for this alleged Soros quote, it\\'s highly unlikely that the billionaire would be so open and candid about a plan to fund \"Black Hate groups,\" manipulate the black community, and bring down the United States in a newspaper interview. (It also makes little sense for Soros, one of the world\\'s richest people and most successful capitalists, to be motivated to dismantle the nation that is home to the planet\\'s largest economy.) Fake quotes are frequently accompanied by false source information in order to make them appear legitimate. This tactic has also been used for viral quotes ostensibly uttered by Presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, for example: Trump was accused of saying that Republicans were the \"dumbest group of voters\" during an interview with People, and Clinton was accused of saying the same of Democratic voters in a 2005 book. Yet neither Clinton nor Trump made such comments. \" I\\'m going to bring down the United States by funding Black Hate groups . We\\'ll put them into a mental trap and make them blame white people . The Black community is the easiest to manipulate . \" - George Soros ( Interview with Germany\\'s BILD - Sept . 2014 )', 'Leftist Activists Demand New York Museum Take Down Statue of Racist\\' Theodore Roosevelt? After \"demanding that southern states take down statues of Confederate figures, the activist Left is now targeting\" a New York City statue of President Teddy Roosevelt. On 15 August 2017, DailyWire.com published an article reporting that the \"activist Left\" was demanding that a statue of Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th President of the United States, be removed from a New York City museum: Social justice warriors are never satisfied. If you give them an inch, they\\'ll take a mile. After demanding that southern states take down statues of Confederate figures, the activist Left is now targeting an iconic American president featured on Mount Rushmore. On Monday, more than 200 SJW zealots held a protest inside the American Museum of Natural History in New York City to take down the supposedly \"racist\" statue of former President Theodore Roosevelt. The protest\\'s organizers, NYC Stands with Standing Rock and Decolonize This Place, also called for Columbus Day to be renamed Indigenous People\\'s Day. \"A stark embodiment of the white supremacy that Roosevelt himself espoused and promoted,\" pontificated the group of protesters in a statement. \"The statue is seen as an affront to all who pass it on entering the museum, but especially to African and Native Americans.\" The article\\'s use of the words \"after\" and \"now\" drew an undeniable parallel between the \"Unite the Right\" protest of 12 August 2017 and the events described. It reported that protesters \"purportedly planned the event three weeks in advance in order to make the bizarre show of leftist rage as special as possible,\" referencing an undated Monday. It linked to a Guardian piece which also stated that a protest occurred on \"Monday\": More than 200 people cheered outside the museum as activists covered the statue of Roosevelt on horseback flanked by an African American and Native American on either side and demanded it be ultimately removed. Activists from the groups NYC Stands with Standing Rock and Decolonize This Place organized the protest to draw attention to the museum\\'s encouragement of racist tropes, and implored New York City to rename Columbus Day to Indigenous People\\'s Day. However, nowhere in the Daily Wire piece was any indication that the source material was dated 11 October 2016, making its implication that such protests were a part of or after 12 August 2017 clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia extremely misleading. Right above the Guardian item\\'s dateline is a note indicating that the piece was nearly a year old as of August 2017: <img class=\"wp-image-100617 aligncenter\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/Take_down__racist__Theodore_Roosevelt_statue__activists_tell_New_York_museum___World_news___The_Guardian.jpg?resize=600,447\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/Take_down__racist__Theodore_Roosevelt_statue__activists_tell_New_York_museum___World_news___The_Guardian.jpg?w=902 902w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/Take_down__racist__Theodore_Roosevelt_statue__activists_tell_New_York_museum___World_news___The_Guardian.jpg?resize=300,224 300w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/Take_down__racist__Theodore_Roosevelt_statue__activists_tell_New_York_museum___World_news___The_Guardian.jpg?resize=768,572 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"> Although it is possible Daily Wire overlooked the Guardian article\\'s date, it added an image taken from Twitter dated 10 October 2016: The \"zealots\" mentioned in the 15 August 2017 Daily Wire item were described in other reports as representatives of a group called \"Decolonize This Place,\" a movement that appears to be completely separate from antifa activists: The collective behind the alternative tour, Decolonize This Place, grew out of the academic and artistic collaborations that began percolating during Occupy Wall Street five years ago. Their museum takeover was a symbolic protest against the gentrification and displacement unfolding just outside the marble walls, in poor communities of color of the surrounding city that are excluded from such elite cultural spheres. The action was incubated in Artists Space in Soho, a freewheeling downtown studio that cultivates innovative contemporary art projects. During their three-month \"takeover\" at Artists Space, Decolonize is hosting meetings, performances and film screenings, along with art builds, in which activists gather to create protest signs, paint banners, and construct other DIY productions focused on gentrification, global labor activism, Palestinian resistance, and movements for indigenous rights around the world. October 2016 news articles reported that the indigenous rights group protested for removal of the statue, modification of exhibits in the American Museum of Natural History, and the return of items they believed were culturally significant artifacts: Four hundred indigenous rights activists occupied the American Museum of Natural History Monday afternoon in protest of Columbus Day and museum exhibitions they consider to be demeaning to indigenous peoples. The protest, which featured a rally on the museum steps, a \"de-colonization\" tour, and the draping of a large parachute over an equestrian statue of Theodore Roosevelt, was organized by the artist activist group Decolonize This Place in collaboration with a number of community groups, including NYC Stands with Standing Rock. Activists made three major demands of the museum: Remove the Roosevelt Statue, modify exhibits related to indigenous peoples and return various indigenous artifacts to the descendants of those to whom they belonged. They also called on the city to rename Columbus Day as \"Indigenous People\\'s Day.\" Videos of the protest show protesters carrying a large \"Abolish White Supremacy\" banner, and it was labeled as an \"expansive action of that included member of Black Lives Matter, Palestinians, Italians and others\": This Teddy is too much to bear. So says Upper West Sider Mike Edison, who\\'s on a decade-long crusade to convince the city and the American Museum of Natural History to remove a statue of President Theodore Roosevelt that he says is racist. \"When you walk into the museum it\\'s the first thing you see and it smacks of white entitlement and exploitation,\" charged Edison, 63, who recently launched an online petition tarnishing the bronze. \"It\\'s indicative of the white man\\'s burden.\\' \" The 10-foot icon, entitled \"Equestrian Statue of Theodore Roosevelt,\" was sculpted by James Earle Fraser in 1939. It depicts the Rough Rider proudly astride his steed, flanked by a bare chested African and Native American. No action occurred between the 10 October 2016 \"Decolonize This Place\" protest at the American Museum of Natural History and the 15 August 2017 publication of the Daily Wire\\'s article, except for unrelated clashes over the 12 August 2017 \"Unite the Right\" white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. It is true that a separate group of indigenous activists and artists protested for the removal of a statue of Teddy Roosevelt in October 2016, but those demonstrators had nothing to do with August 2017 protests in Charlottesville, Virginia.

An academic study cited by conservative news organizations and the Trump administration proved that Hillary Clinton received more than 800,000 non-citizen votes in the 2016 presidential election. A recurring refrain issuing from President Trump\\'s Twitter account ever since he won the 2016 election by 74 electoral votes in November holds that he was robbed of a victory in the popular vote count (which Hillary Clinton won by 2,865,075 votes) due to at least 3 million illegal ballots cast by non-citizens. The documentation offered to support this assertion has ranged from vague to nonexistent. When asked to defend it in a 24 January 2017 press conference, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer stated that Trump\\'s belief that there was massive voter fraud in 2016 was \"based on studies he\\'s seen.\" Pressed to cite such a study, Spicer said, \"There\\'s one that came out of Pew in 2008 that showed 14 percent of people who voted were non-citizens.\" Albeit mistaken about both its origins (it was written by researchers at Old Dominion University using data collected by the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, not Pew) and findings (it did not remotely show that 14 percent of the electorate amounting to 18 million voters were non-citizens), Spicer was, at least, alluding to an actual study. In fact, the same study was cited for the same purposes two days after the press conference in a Washington Times article stating that Hillary Clinton benefited to the tune of 834,381 non-citizen votes in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton garnered more than 800,000 votes from non-citizens on Nov. 8, an approximation far short of President Trump\\'s estimate of up to 5 million illegal voters but supportive of his charges of fraud. Political scientist Jesse Richman of Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, has worked with colleagues to produce groundbreaking research on non-citizen voting, and this week he posted a blog in response to Mr. Trump\\'s assertion. Based on national polling by a consortium of universities, a report by Mr. Richman said 6.4 percent of the estimated 20 million adult non-citizens in the U.S. voted in November. He extrapolated that that percentage would have added 834,381 net votes for Mrs. Clinton, who received about 2.8 million more votes than Mr. Trump. The study in question was published in the December 2014 issue of the journal Electoral Studies, titled: \"Do Non-Citizens Vote in U.S. Elections?\" Its authors, Jesse T. Richman, Gulshan A. Chattha, and David C. Earnest of Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, sought to contribute hard data to the ongoing, largely partisan debate over how much voter fraud actually occurs in the United States. Richman and Earnest summarized their research in a 24 October 2014 article in the Washington Post: Our data comes from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES). Its large number of observations (32,800 in 2008 and 55,400 in 2010) provide sufficient samples of the non-immigrant sub-population, with 339 non-citizen respondents in 2008 and 489 in 2010. For the 2008 CCES, we also attempted to match respondents to voter files so that we could verify whether they actually voted. How many non-citizens participate in U.S. elections? More than 14 percent of non-citizens in both the 2008 and 2010 samples indicated that they were registered to vote. Furthermore, some of these non-citizens voted. Our best guess, based upon extrapolations from the portion of the sample with a verified vote, is that 6.4 percent of non-citizens voted in 2008 and 2.2 percent of non-citizens voted in 2010. Because non-citizens tended to favor Democrats (Obama won more than 80 percent of the votes of non-citizens in the 2008 CCES sample), we find that this participation was large enough to plausibly account for Democratic victories in a few close elections. To be clear, when Sean Spicer cited this study to support Trump\\'s assertion that millions voted illegally in the 2016 election, he was referring to a set of extrapolations made in 2014 based on data collected by another research group in 2008 and 2010. Further, the validity of those extrapolations has been repeatedly challenged by the original pollsters (more about that later). Just as importantly, the lead author of the study advancing those extrapolations, Jesse Richman, has said that even if their conclusions were 100 percent valid which, again, is in question they don\\'t confirm Trump\\'s claim that \"millions\" voted illegally: Donald Trump recently suggested that his deficit in the popular vote to Clinton might be due entirely to illegal votes cast, for instance by non-citizens. Is this claim plausible? The claim Trump is making is not supported by our data. Here I run some extrapolations based upon the estimates for other elections from my coauthored 2014 paper on non-citizen voting. You can access that paper on the journal website here and Judicial Watch has also posted a PDF. The basic assumptions on which the extrapolation is based are that 6.4 percent of non-citizens voted, and that of the non-citizens who voted, 81.8 percent voted for Clinton and 17.5 percent voted for Trump. These were numbers from our study for the 2008 campaign. Obviously to the extent that critics of my study are correct the first number (percentage of non-citizens who voted) may be too high, and the second number (percentage who voted for Clinton) may be too low. The count of the popular vote is still in flux as many states have yet to certify official final tallies. Here I used this unofficial tally linked by Real Clear Politics. As of this writing Trump is 2,235,663 votes behind Clinton in the popular vote. If the assumptions stated above concerning non-citizen turnout are correct, could non-citizen turnout account for Clinton\\'s popular vote margin? There is no way it could have. 6.4 percent turnout among the roughly 20.3 million non-citizen adults in the US would add only 834,318 votes to Clinton\\'s popular vote margin. This is little more than a third of the total margin. Is it plausible that non-citizen votes added to Clinton\\'s margin. Yes. Is it plausible that non-citizen votes account for the entire nation-wide popular vote margin held by Clinton? Not at all. Returning to the Washington Times piece defending Trump\\'s assertion about illegal voters (see top of page), the article creates the impression, perhaps intentionally, that Richman conducted fresh research using new data from the 2016 election. However, in a 27 January 2017 open letter to the Times, Richman objected that both his research and his own comments about the research were misrepresented: I do not support the Washington Times piece Dear Washington Times, As a primary author cited in this piece, I need to say that I think the Washington Times article is deceptive. It makes it sound like I have done a study concerning the 2016 election. I have not. What extrapolation I did to the 2016 election was purely and explicitly and exclusively for the purpose of pointing out that my 2014 study of the 2008 election did not provide evidence of voter fraud at the level some Trump administration people were claiming it did. I do not think that one should rely upon that extrapolation for any other purpose. And I do not stand behind that extrapolation if used for ANY other purpose. Best Regards, Jesse Richman Finally, we must address the question of whether the extrapolations Richman et al made in their 2014 study were valid in the first place. Let us turn to one of the pollsters who compiled the original Cooperative Congressional Election Study voter data in 2008 and 2010, Brian Schaffner, who wrote: As a member of the team that produces the datasets upon which that study was based and as the co-author of an article published in the same journal that provides a clear \"take down\" of the study in question, I can say unequivocally that this research is not only wrong, it is irresponsible social science and should never have been published in the first place. There is no evidence that non-citizens have voted in recent U.S. elections. Although based on precisely the same data as Richman\\'s, Schaffner\\'s conclusion could not be more starkly different. To simplify his argument (which we encourage all to read in full), the Richman study failed to account for measurement error specifically, it failed to account for the frequency with which survey respondents may have incorrectly identified themselves as \"non-citizens\": Such errors are infrequent, but they happen in any survey. In this case, they were crucial, because Richman and his colleagues saw the very small number of people who answered that they were \"immigrant non-citizens,\" and extrapolated that (inaccurate) number to the U.S. population as a whole. How do we know that some people give an inaccurate response to this question? Well, we actually took 19,000 respondents from one of the surveys that Richman used (the 2010 study) and we interviewed them again in 2012. A total of 121 of the 19,000 respondents (.64 percent) identified themselves as immigrant non-citizens when they first answered the survey in 2010. However, when asked the question again in 2012, 36 of the 121 selected a different response, indicating that they were citizens. Even more telling was this: 20 respondents identified themselves as citizens in 2010 but then in 2012 changed their answers to indicate that they were non-citizens. It is highly unrealistic to go from being a citizen in 2010 to a non-citizen in 2012, which provides even stronger evidence that some people were providing incorrect responses to this question for idiosyncratic reasons. Correcting for those errors, says Schaffner, the likely number of non-citizen voters in the 2016 election turns out to be not 5 million, nor 3 million, nor even 800,000, but zero.
